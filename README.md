# Programming-For-Data-Analysis-Project

### About the Assignment
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:

 - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
 - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
 - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
 - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

### How to view the Assignment

The assignment can be viewed the following ways

1. Downloading the Repo and running jupyter notebook in the command line. (Recommended)
2. Clicking on the "Gym-Membership.ipynb" file above,

I recommend that you download and run the assignment on your own machine as some headings are missing when directly clicking on the "Gym_Membership.ipynb" file above

### What is needed to run the Assignment

1. Anaconda Python as it contains all libraries
2. The Repo will need to be cloned or downloaded
