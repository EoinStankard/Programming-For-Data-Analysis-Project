    "#### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of\n",
    "your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is\n",
    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    " - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    " - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    " - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The project I will be working on is Gym membership, I will simulate data for the following variables\n",
    "\n",
    " - Gender (Male/Female)\n",
    " - Age\n",
    " - Fitness Level\n",
    " - Payment Type (Monthly/Yearly)\n",
    " - Smoker\n",
    " - Profession (Student/Professional)\n",
    " - Weight (BMI)\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be researching to be able to create a data frame that will be created from figures given online. I believe this is an interesting area to researh as the fitness industy has boomed in the last 5 years or so. This is dues to alot of different factors such as a large increase of personal and group training programs, fitness wearables (fitbit,apple watch), affordable gyms and being able to stream different exercises easily on platforms like Instagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Gym Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    " - Over 1 in 5 Americans belong to at least one U.S. health club or studio\n",
    " - There were 62.5 US million gym members in 2018, up 2.6% from 60.9 million in 2017\n",
    " - Gym attendance statistics show that these 62.5 million health club members use a club or studio for an average of 104 days a year \n",
    " - There are also 9 million non-members who attend a club or studio for an average of 24 days a year\n",
    " - Between 2008 and 2018, membership has grown by 37.1%, while the total number of club-goers has increased by 34%\n",
    " - UK gym membership statistics reveal that there are almost 10 million gym members nationwide\n",
    " - The UK penetration rate is 14.9% which equates to 1 in every 7 people being a member of a gym"

    "Smoking increases your resting heart rate. Your resting heart rate is how many beats per minute your heart produces when you are not being active. When you smoke, this number is increased because of the extra work your heart has to do to keep your body going. Your heart rate could possibly rise to dangerous levels to perform the physical activities you're asking your heart to do. A higher than normal resting heart rate can increase the risk of death.\n",

    "##### Lungs\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re able to exercise better when your lung capacity is good and your lungs work well. Smoking hurts your lung capacity. The tar in cigarette smoke coats your lungs and makes the air sacs less elastic. Smoking also produces phlegm that can make your lungs congested. Smoking even a few cigarettes a day can decrease your body’s ability to use oxygen effectively. \n"
